This project involves building a Streamlit application that allows users to interact with PDFs for Q&A functionality. I utilized transformer models to generate embeddings and efficiently stored the resulting vectors using Qdrant, an open-source vector database. The core of the Q&A system was developed using Langchain, where I integrated advanced language models like Phi-2 and Ollama. This integration significantly improved query response times by 25%. The app provides an efficient and user-friendly interface for extracting insights and answering questions from uploaded PDF documents.
